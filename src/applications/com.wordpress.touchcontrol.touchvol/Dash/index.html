		<h1><b> Swipe this card away any time. It exists to launch the dashboard above.</b></h1><br>
		<p><b> Why is this here?</b></p>
		<p> Loading profiles from the Launchpoint 'shortcuts' requires a program to catch the request.  Since it would be pointless to handle a shortcut with opening the full blown gui, I need a hidden program to process the request. There are two options:</p>
		<ul><li><b>Dashboards</b> - the little speaker icon for touchvol should be up there now.  As long as it remains open you can use the Launchpoints without other windows opening.  You can close it like any other Dashboard, but launchpoints will open this window without it.</li>
		<li><b>Luna Patch</b> - The other option requires a patch to change a luna setting to allow a hidden launcher to start with Luna and  remain open. This would be the preferred behavior model and allows the most transparency of use.  The patch is installable from the application menu in Touchvol and will require a Luna restart. It adds Touchvol to two entries (LaunchAtBoot and KeepAlive) in either the luna.conf or luna-platform.conf (varies on OS version) to gain the desired result. The patch installer backs up a copy of the modified file appending .touchvol-backup to the filename in the original location (/etc/palm).  This file will be left in place after application removal as a safety measure. The patch itself will be automatically removed with the application. A log file will be created: /media/internal/touchvol-patch.log containing a diff of the entries added/removed and a few other items.  If you experience problems removing the patch this log is the first thing to look at.</li></ul>
		<p><b>More Info:</b></p>
		<p>Enyo apps are currently unable to launch a hidden app and remain open for longer than 60 seconds.  This means that to hold open the application I have to launch a dashboard or allow it special attributes in luna.  The patch effectively it gets rid of the launcher window and the Dashboard above, replacing them with a hidden handler.  I leave this in place to make sure the user has a choice about whether they want to have this handler running or not.  If there is anyone with knowledge, and an ability to demonstrate functionally different enyo behavior that would lead to an easier/cleaner/better solution, please do speak up.</p></div>
