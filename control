This is optional and replaces the dashboard launcher which will start by default when you run a launchpoint.  An included message window will also appear with more detail when you run a launchpoint without the patch installed.<br><br><b>Media Patch:</b><br>The default pulseaudio setup makes adjustments each time it changes 'modes' (speaker, headphone, etc). In order to prevent automatic changes on these mode events, these patches offer the ability to remove it from the media profile.  <b>To take effect a pulseaudio or device restart is required.</b> Choose Undo to reset all of them to the default file.
